      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div class="bio">
        <p>I am a fourth-year student, studying Kinesiology at <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/" target="_blank">San Jose State University</a>. I plan to focus my degree on specializing in Exercise Sciences to help others create a healthier lifestyle. As someone who has a passion for fitness, I wish to help others reach their goals as well. I chose to become a personal trainer because I enjoy to watch others succeed in their fitness journey. Watching many of my friends hit their goals in the gym was more exciting than for me to hit my own goals. Seeing others succeed after seeing oneâ€™s hard work creates a lot of motivation for me to keep helping others.</p>
